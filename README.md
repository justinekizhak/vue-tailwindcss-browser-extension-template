# Vue TailwindCSS browser extension template

| Dependency  | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| VueJs       | 2.6     |
| TailwindCss | 2       |

Created using [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/).

## Usage

### I have Cookiecutter already installed

```sh
cookiecutter gh:justinekizhak/vue-tailwind-browser-extension-template
```

### I don't have Cookiecutter and I don't want to keep it after I have used it

In this case we will be using pipx.

TLDR;

Pipx is a great tool and you should probably use it anyways

1. Install pipx

```sh
pip install pipx
```

Know more about [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx).

2. Run

```sh
pipx run cookiecutter gh:justinekizhak/vue-tailwind-browser-extension-template
```

### I don't mind Cookiecutter being installed

1. Install cookiecutter

TLDR;

```sh
pipx install cookiecutter
```

Probably best to refer the cookiecutter docs.

2. Follow these instructions [I have Cookiecutter already installed](#i-have-cookiecutter-already-installed)
